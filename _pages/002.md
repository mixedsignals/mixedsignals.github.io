      "Synaesthetic Object (Coltrane) is a live audio-visual performance that uses computer analysis of John Coltrane's Ascension (1965) as the basis for a real-time 3D rendering of a shape. The performer manipulates the rendering throughout the performance by altering a set of improvisation parameters that control how the shape shifts and behaves. The sound in the piece is derived from a direct scan of the geometry of the shape at different frequencies, creating an ever-shifting drone. The use of a seminal free jazz album as, effectively, a noise source for generative graphics allows the performed shape and resulting music to have a nuanced vocabulary of gestures that translate into a highly expressive canvas for synaesthetic performance."

      "Bureau of Ships is a multi-part project based on re-building vintage military oscilloscopes as music synthesizers, hybridizing the classic analog electronics in the devices with "implants" of miniature digital components. The resulting re-purposed objects are at once sound generators, performable musical instruments, and interesting sculptural objects. And the transformation of these military objects into harmless, playable, and playfully conceived objects is not an insignificant part of the project."

      "Written during my time in the Arctic, Elk + Hunter is a retelling of the Persephone myth from Persephony's point of view. The story is set in the context of Sami mythology + our post post internet world. In the very North of the world at the source of the world river, where the ice melts into the purest of the waters we drink here on Earth–live the Hunter and Elk Queen. This world of the North is the land where the Sun goes to sleep, and our souls go when we die, it is where all life comes from, and where all life ends..."

      "Scorpion Mouse is the unholy union between Jason Levine the livecoding scorpion, and May Cheung the squeaktastic singing mouse. Together they navigate the sonic landscape of the audio t-SNE. Always improvising, it's impossible to know where they'll start or where they end up. Only one thing is for sure: We're all gonna die. But tonight... Tonight we're rocking out to Scorpion Mouse."
