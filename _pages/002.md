  Fantasies of manga and sci-fi cast our future into the new, the streets of neo-Tokyo and the skies of neo-New York. But the all-too-real reality of the present digital and of the individual exploded across the Internet finds us already folded into our imagined futures like a warm Hollandaise sauce. The ingredients are one part human warmth, one part machine intelligence. As the mixture cools we start to see artistic reflections of the modern moment. In sound, light, and dance, on April 8th at the Umbrella Factory, come taste the sauce with us.

      Synaesthetic Object (Coltrane) is a live audio-visual performance that uses computer analysis of John Coltrane's Ascension (1965) as the basis for a real-time 3D rendering of a shape. The performer manipulates the rendering throughout the performance by altering a set of improvisation parameters that control how the shape shifts and behaves. The sound in the piece is derived from a direct scan of the geometry of the shape at different frequencies, creating an ever-shifting drone. The use of a seminal free jazz album as, effectively, a noise source for generative graphics allows the performed shape and resulting music to have a nuanced vocabulary of gestures that translate into a highly expressive canvas for synaesthetic performance.

      Bureau of Ships is a multi-part project based on re-building vintage military oscilloscopes as music synthesizers, hybridizing the classic analog electronics in the devices with "implants" of miniature digital components. The resulting re-purposed objects are at once sound generators, performable musical instruments, and interesting sculptural objects. And the transformation of these military objects into harmless, playable, and playfully conceived objects is not an insignificant part of the project.

      Written during my time in the Arctic, Elk + Hunter is a retelling of the Persephone myth from Persephony's point of view. The story is set in the context of Sami mythology + our post post internet world. In the very North of the world at the source of the world river, where the ice melts into the purest of the waters we drink here on Earth–live the Hunter and Elk Queen. This world of the North is the land where the Sun goes to sleep, and our souls go when we die, it is where all life comes from, and where all life ends...

      Scorpion Mouse is duo of two dynamic improvisors, May Cheung, vocalist and Jason Levine, livecoder.  Jason livecode's custom software that allows him to traverse geographies of audio samples to create dense rhythmic compositions. May's lush vocals glide atop the canopy of percussion, weaving and wending as the rhythms are transmogrified.
