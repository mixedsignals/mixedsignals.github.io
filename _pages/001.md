  Technology is enmeshed. People are enmeshed. Confusion emerges: what exactly does it mean to be enmeshed? <em>Where does all the mesh come from?</em> The result is a tortured self.

      Isomorphs is an investigation into the plasticity of the relationship between meaning and stimulus in the post-digital age. Drawing material from a variety of 'functional' media, including commonly used ringtones, alarms, and a variety of western cultural signifiers (arena-rock guitar, auto-tune sludge, etc), these sources are analyzed for melodic and gestural information via audio-to-MIDI processes, then re-mapped onto various compositional parameters and re-presented in both raw and manipulated states.

      Inspired by the Granular Synthesis work Modell 5, In Triplicate is an exploration in three-dimensional audio-visual sampling of the performer’s face and voice. Contemporary sampling techniques primarily rely on a two-dimensional time axis but by making use of slit-scan techniques the instrument renders multiple moments in time simultaneously. Embracing generative art techniques the instrument hands off a subset of the control parameters and decision making to the computer while keeping the macro control of processes at the performer’s finger tips.

      Resonance is an attempt to express the imperfect, yet emotional tone of our memories through the element of sound. It is a live, motion-scored performance of a memory that has already occurred. Using wireless motion capture technologies, two dancers were recorded during a duet. a single dancer recreates the original performance solo, moving to the memory of her partner. Both her present movements and her remembered interactions of the original performance are translated into sound, creating, live, an entirely unique score with each dance.
